# FingerprintAuthentication
Android brought significant changes to Android APIs, including Android Fingerprint API, with the release of Android Marshmallow. 
This new API allows developers to confirm user’s identity with a single touch. And, while this feature is commonly used to secure lockscreen, developers can now also implement in Android apps.
Here, we’ve a created a demo on [How to Integrate Android Fingerprint API to Confirm User’s Identity With Single Touch](https://www.spaceotechnologies.com/integrate-android-fingerprint-api-tutorial/). 

If you want to implement this feature in your Android app and looking to Hire [Android App Development Company](http://www.spaceotechnologies.com/android-app-development/) to help you, then you can contact Space-O Technologies for the same.
